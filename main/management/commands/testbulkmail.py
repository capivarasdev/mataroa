Google and search engines were inefficient in helping people
discover web content.

The need re-arises in 2020, when search engines are influenced by SEO
techniques and content platforms have become silos. These days, an indie
web revival would be incredible.

A webring has a specific theme, and the links that comprise it are
curated. Manually curating a webring's content means that it has been
agreed that the website's content is relevant to the webring's theme.
The modern web approach would be to add a neural network to figure out
the website's theme, but that would be totally not fly!
